# ELCS Documentation

<div class="callout callout--info">
  <strong>TL;DR</strong> ELCS (Epistemic Light-Cone Swarm) is a practical framework for building software with AI agents. It keeps state in files, enforces quality gates, and scales rigor as risk increases.

## What is ELCS

ELCS is a lightweight, agent-agnostic methodology for AI-assisted development. It replaces fragile, chat-only memory with durable artifacts and a repeatable decision loop.

## Why it matters

AI tools are powerful but forgetful. ELCS fixes context loss, goal drift, and fuzzy completion criteria by making decisions explicit, testable, and auditable.

## Core elements

- **Persistent artifacts** in files (state, spec, tokens, checkpoints)
- **6 quality gates** that must be passed before work proceeds
- **Multi-lens evaluation** to catch blind spots early
- **Stage-based scaling** so process matches risk and complexity

## How to use

Start small: read the overview, copy the template, and let ELCS guide the first session. As your project grows, you'll activate more structure only when it provides clear value.

## Who it's for

- Builders who want predictable outcomes from AI assistance
- Teams coordinating multiple agents or contributors
- Anyone who values measurable progress and traceable decisions
