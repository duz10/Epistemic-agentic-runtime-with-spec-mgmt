# ELCS Project Assumptions

*Tracking what we assume to be true about the ELCS Framework project*

## Active Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Status |
|----|------------|------------|--------|
| A1 | AI agents will respect bootstrap files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules) | 0.85 | Active |
| A2 | File-based artifacts are more durable than agent memory | 0.95 | Active |
| A3 | ELCS can be implemented progressively (L0→L4) without breaking | 0.75 | Active |
| A4 | Unique terminology prevents confusion with other methodologies | 0.70 | Active |
| A5 | EAR methodology is sufficient to complete this project | 0.90 | Active |

## Evidence Links

- **A1** ← E1 (observed behavior in Code-puppy, Claude Code)
- **A2** ← E2 (EAR template persistence works)
- **A5** ← E3 (EAR has guided us to scaffolding)
