# Assumptions

*What we believe to be true about this project*

> Assumptions are explicit beliefs with confidence scores.
> They should be revisited as evidence accumulates.

## Active Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Evidence |
|----|------------|------------|----------|
| - | (None yet — populate during Stage 1) | - | - |

## How to Add Assumptions

During Stage 1 (Epistemic State Creation), document assumptions like:

```
| A1 | Users have stable internet connections | 0.85 | E1 |
| A2 | The existing API is stable | 0.70 | - |
```

Each assumption should have:
- **ID**: A1, A2, etc.
- **Text**: What you're assuming
- **Confidence**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Evidence**: Links to supporting evidence (if any)

## Retired Assumptions

(Assumptions that were revised or no longer apply)
