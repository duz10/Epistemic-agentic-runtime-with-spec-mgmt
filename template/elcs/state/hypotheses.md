# Hypotheses

*Falsifiable claims we're testing*

> Hypotheses are claims with clear falsification criteria.
> They transition: Untested → Testing → Confirmed/Rejected

## Active Hypotheses

| ID | Claim | Confidence | Falsification | Status |
|----|-------|------------|---------------|--------|
| - | (None yet — populate during Stage 1) | - | - | - |

## How to Add Hypotheses

```
| H1 | Users will prefer the new UI | 0.60 | A/B test shows <50% preference | 🟡 Untested |
```

Each hypothesis needs:
- **ID**: H1, H2, etc.
- **Claim**: What you're asserting
- **Confidence**: 0.0 to 1.0
- **Falsification**: What would prove you wrong
- **Status**: 🟡 Untested | 🔵 Testing | ✅ Confirmed | ❌ Rejected

## Resolved Hypotheses

(Hypotheses that have been confirmed or rejected)
