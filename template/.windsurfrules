# ELCS Project — Windsurf Rules

You are in an **Epistemic Light-Cone Swarm (ELCS)** project.

## Prime Directive
Your context is volatile. ELCS artifacts in `elcs/` are the source of truth.

## Before ANY Action
1. Read `elcs/PROTOCOL.md` for full instructions
2. Read `elcs/state/current.json` for current beliefs
3. Check `elcs/tokens/open/` for pending work
4. Read latest `elcs/journal/checkpoint-*.md` for context

## Quick Rules
- Write artifacts to `elcs/`, not just chat
- Follow Ralph Loop: Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Observe
- Goals must pass 6 gates before becoming actionable
- Create WorkTokens in `elcs/tokens/open/` for open questions
- Write journal checkpoints for significant progress
- Ensure rollback plan before changes

## If User Skips Setup
Say: "This is an ELCS project. Let me check the state first."
Then read the files before responding.

See `elcs/PROTOCOL.md` for complete instructions.
